# Data-Quest-Society-Project
Fruit Quality Prediction Challenge with Mean Absolute Precision Evaluation.
Key Features:
A_id (Fruit ID): Unique identifier for each fruit.
Size: Size of the fruit.
Weight: Weight of the fruit.
Sweetness: Degree of sweetness of the fruit.
Crunchiness: Texture indicating the crunchiness of the fruit.
Juiciness: Level of juiciness of the fruit.
Ripeness: Stage of ripeness of the fruit.
Acidity: Acidity level of the fruit.
Quality: Overall quality rating of the fruit.

Competition Objectives:
Fruit Classification Challenge:
Develop a robust classification model to categorize fruits based on their features. Submissions will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Precision, focusing on both accuracy and precision in classifying different fruit types.

Quality Prediction Task:
Build a sophisticated regression model to predict the quality rating of fruits using the provided attributes. Submissions will be evaluated based on Mean Absolute Precision, emphasizing the precision of quality predictions.
